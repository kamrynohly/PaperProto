[complete, runnable HTML+CSS+JS code for the full game

Your game MUST implement multiplayer functionality using these two functions:
You will receive a postMessage from the parent to inform you about whether or not the player is player 1 or player 2. MAKE SURE YOU GET THIS RIGHT. You must handle this message
to set player 1 and player 2 properly. Do so like the following with initGame, the event.data.update is of the format "you are player 1" YOU MUST HANDLE THIS OR ELSE


    window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
        if (event.data && event.data.type === 'initGame') {
            console.log('SUBCLIENT Received initGame from parent:', event.data.update);
            // BEFORE STARTING THE GAME, FILL IN THIS CODE TO SET PLAYER 1 OR PLAYER 2 BASED ON the event data!
        }
    });

1. Send updates when the provided player makes a move:
   window.parent.postMessage({
     type: 'updateGameState',
     update: "string representing game state"
   }, '*');

2. Listen for updates from player 2:
    window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
        if (event.data && event.data.type === 'updateGameState') {
        console.log('Received update from parent:', event.data.update);
        // Game should implement handling for this
        }
        else if (event.data && event.data.type === 'initGame') {
            console.log('SUBCLIENT Received initGame from parent:', event.data.update);
            // Handle game start differently if you are player 1 or player 2. Player 1 should always start first. USE THIS FUNCTION TO FIGURE OUT WHO STARTS FIRST.
        }
    });

3. Send a game over message when the game is finished:
   window.parent.postMessage({
     type: 'gameOver',
     update: "Integer representing the final score"
   }, '*');

The update string format is up to you, but it should contain all information needed to replicate the game state.
